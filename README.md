React TODO App
===

Part of the course on Udemy - ["The Complete React Web Developer Course"](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course) - I highly recommend it if you want to learn how to React. It's a bit on the newbie side of things as far as web development goes, but you may skip through the whole GitHub/CSS/Heroku part.
